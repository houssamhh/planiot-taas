# Scenarios

This directory contains three subdirectories: ```emergency```, ```increasing-subscriptions```, and ```medium-load```. These subdirectories contain the input and output files for running the experiments in [1].

* ```emergency```: contains input and output files for running an experiment for an overloaded IoT system in an emergency situations. 
* ```increasing-subscriptions```: contains input and output files for running an experiment for an IoT system with an increasing number of subscriptions that eventually overload the system, from 20 subscriptions to 100 subscriptions.
* ```medium-load```: contains input and output files for running an experiment for a medium loaded IoT system with 80 subscriptions.
